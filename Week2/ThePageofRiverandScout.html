We were born on July 11, 2018 and adopted on November 26 that same year.

#### Our Names
River Stone was so named because he has a subtle stripe, like a shiny river stone. He also loves playing in water. His favorite time of day is either human shower time or plant watering time (or snuggle time. TBH it’s probably snuggle time).

Scout T. is an explorer—always sneaking through doorways to places he doesn’t belong, like the great outdoors! Although he was smaller than River when he was adopted, he’s now nearly 2 pounds heavier than his brother! Scout is also a good caretaker cat, grooming all of his family members, including his humans.

## 2 cats, 2 attitudes

While we are litter mates and have lived our whole lives together, that doesn’t mean we’re identical twins! I mean, just look at us! We look totally different.

Although both of us are “street cats,” Scout looks like a snowshoe breed, which is a variety of Siamese. River is black with dark brown stripes and white paws (and a few stray white hairs here and there, too).
