    <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p> Hello! We are <strong>River S.</strong> (Stone) and <strong>Scout T.</strong> (just T.)<strong> Goldrice</strong>.</p>

      <ul>
          <li> We are 1 year old cats </li>
          <li> We love to play (with toy mice, fluffy balls, and our scratcher) </li>
          <li> We love eating </li>
          <li> We love sleeping </li>
          <li> We are <em>very</em> cute </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>We were born on July 11, 2018 and adopted on November 26 that same year. We came from <a href="https://kittenrescue.org/">Kitten Rescue Los Angeles</a>. We were such babies! Very snuggly, very active, and very, very cute.</p>

    <h3> Our Names</h3>

    <img src="images/grooming.jpg" alt="a cat with partially closed eyes and tongue out, licking a finger" style="width: 190px; padding: 0 15px; float: left;"/>

      <p> River Stone was so named because he has a subtle stripe, like a shiny river stone. He also loves playing in water. His favorite time of day is either human shower time or plant watering time (or <strong>snuggle time</strong>. TBH it’s probably snuggle time). He is a very good jumper, maybe because he was a very <span class="long">long</span> kitten. He likes to jump onto window sills and reach high for dangling toys.  </p>

      <p> Scout T. is an explorer—always sneaking through doorways to places he doesn’t belong, like the great outdoors! Although he was smaller than River when he was adopted, he’s now nearly 2 pounds heavier than his brother! Scout is also a good caretaker cat, grooming all of his family members, including his humans. Here I am licking a very tasty finger. What does it taste like? The outside world, of course!</p>

    <h2> 2 cats, 2 attitudes </h2>

    <p> While we are litter mates and have lived our whole lives together, that doesn’t mean we’re identical twins! I mean, just look at us! We look totally different. </p>

    <p>Although both of us are “street cats,” Scout looks like a snowshoe breed, which is a variety of Siamese. River is black with dark brown stripes and white paws (and a few stray white hairs here and there, too).</p>

    <h3>Our Favorite Things</h3>

    <p>We also have <strong>different</strong> favorite things.</p>
