    <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p> Hello! We are <strong>River S.</strong> (Stone) and <strong>Scout T.</strong> (just T.)<strong> Goldrice</strong>.</p>

      <ul>
          <li> We are 1 year old cats </li>
          <li> We love to play (with toy mice, fluffy balls, and our scratcher) </li>
          <li> We love eating </li>
          <li> We love sleeping </li>
          <li> We are <em>very</em> cute </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>We were born on July 11, 2018 and adopted on November 26 that same year. We came from <a href="https://kittenrescue.org/">Kitten Rescue Los Angeles</a>. We were such babies! Very snuggly, very active, and very, very cute.</p>

    <h3> Our Names</h3>

    <img src="images/grooming.jpg" alt="a cat with partially closed eyes and tongue out, licking a finger" style="width: 190px; padding: 0 15px; float: left;"/>

      <p> River Stone was so named because he has a subtle stripe, like a shiny river stone. He also loves playing in water. His favorite time of day is either human shower time or plant watering time (or <strong>snuggle time</strong>. TBH it’s probably snuggle time). He is a very good jumper, maybe because he was a very <span class="long">long</span> kitten. He likes to jump onto window sills and reach high for dangling toys.  </p>

      <p> Scout T. is an explorer—always sneaking through doorways to places he doesn’t belong, like the great outdoors! Although he was smaller than River when he was adopted, he’s now nearly 2 pounds heavier than his brother! Scout is also a good caretaker cat, grooming all of his family members, including his humans. Here he is licking a very tasty finger. What does it taste like? The outside world, of course!</p>

    <h2> 2 cats, 2 attitudes </h2>

    <p> While we are litter mates and have lived our whole lives together, that doesn’t mean we’re identical twins! I mean, just look at us! We look totally different. </p>

    <p>Although both of us are “street cats,” Scout looks like a snowshoe breed, which is a variety of Siamese. River is black with dark brown stripes and white paws (and a few stray white hairs here and there, too).</p>

    <h3>Our Favorite Things</h3>

    <p>We also have <strong>different</strong> favorite things.</p>

    <p>One thing we have in common though is that we are both <strong>great</strong> cats! We were very cute as babies, which is why we used baby pictures on this website. But we're bigger now! If you want to see newer photos of us, you can check out this <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AD2K4vtB6yVq5YEz8">Google album</a> or ask our cat momma for more. I wish we could tell you to follow us on Instagram, but alas, we're not allowed to have cell phones.</p>
